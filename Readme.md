## Directions ##


- Our Database has two separate routes with a third on the way in a future implementation.
- Our first path is 'https://openvillage.herokuapp.com/events' this gives you access to all of our current and upcoming event data!
- Our second Path is 'https://openvillage.herokuapp.com/neighbors' this give you access to all of our user data, new users will be stored here.
- If you are looking to get specific data simply add the ID # of the user or event you are looking for with a /id# at the end of the current URL and you will receive the data that you are requesting!
- Feel free to add a new event on our deployed app, the link is found below.
- You can always check out or Front-End Repo to see how we tied it all together!
- If you are checking out our code you will need to do an npm install do install our our dependencies
